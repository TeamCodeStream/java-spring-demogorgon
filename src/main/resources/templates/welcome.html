        After clicking the links above, there will be a message with the transaction/span name that was generated with the request.<br/>
        This span is generated by the automatic instrumentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should also be a child span, its name starting with "Custom/" (except for Auto instrumentation only). That span is generated by an
        instrumentation referenced by the link. These child spans are all manually generated, but may use the same mechanism used by auto instrumentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also check the <em>OtherTransaction/manual/setup</em> transaction/span. This transaction is started by manual instrumentation, unlike all the others
        which are started by some instrumentation module. It is run only once during application startup.
